## Overview

This project implements a single-image haze removal technique using the Dark Channel Prior, as described in the research paper: ``Single Image Haze Removal Using Dark Channel Prior``
The dehazing algorithm is designed to enhance the quality of images affected by haze. This method is effective for various applications in image processing where haze reduction is required.

## Introduction

Haze removal is essential for enhancing image clarity and visibility in outdoor scenes, improving the performance of vision-based applications.

## Features

- **Single Image Dehazing**  
  Process one image at a time to remove haze and bring out hidden details using the Dark Channel Prior.
- **Bulk Image Dehazing**  
  Process multiple images simultaneously. This feature is perfect for efficiently dehazing an entire batch of images.
- **Video Dehazing**  
  Dehaze video files by processing each frame individually to ensure a clear and detailed output even for moving visual content.
